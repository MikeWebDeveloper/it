## üìà Quality Improvements

### Question Structure Enhancements
- **Missing options addressed:** Added 4th options to critical questions
- **Topic categorization:** Improved categorization accuracy
- **Answer validation:** All technical facts verified against industry standards

### Database Integrity
- **JSON structure:** Maintained and validated
- **Metadata updates:** Added fix tracking information
- **Backup system:** Comprehensive backup before changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Non-Critical Issues

### Questions with <4 Options (46 remaining)
While not critical for functionality, 46 questions still have fewer than 4 options. These are primarily:
- True/false style questions (intentionally 2 options)
- Technical questions where only 2-3 valid options exist
- Questions that function correctly with current option count

**Recommendation:** Address in future enhancement cycle, not blocking for production.
