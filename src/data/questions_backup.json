      "explanation": "Minimize the risk of electrostatic discharge. Whenever 2 things touch, there is always an exchange of electrons at the atomic level. Most of the time, this exchange is so negligible that you don’t notice it, but even tiny bolts of static electricity can fry your RAM modules.

      "explanation": "An IPv6 address is made up of 128 bits that are represented as eight blocks of four hexadecimal digits that are called hextets. Because each hexadecimal digit represents four bits, each hextet represents 16 bits. The /64 network prefix indicates that the first 64 bits, or first four hextets, represent the network portion of the address. Because there are 128 bits in an IPv6 address, this leaves the last 64 bits, or last four hextets, to represent the host identifier. The value for the last four hextets is 0607:1234:aa10:ba01.",

      "explanation": "The Windows 10 boot process is as follows: 1 . PreBoot: POST or Power-On Self-Test loads firmware settings. It checks for a valid disk system, and if the system is good to go for the next phase. If the computer has a valid MBR, i.e. Master Boot Record, the boot process moves further and loads Windows Boot Manager. 2 . Windows Boot Manager: This step determines if you have multiple OS installed on your computer. If yes, then it offers a menu with the names of the OSs. When you select the OS, it will load the right program, i.e. Winload.exe to boot you into the correct OS. 3 . Windows OS Loader: WinLoad.exe loads important drivers to kick start the Windows Kernel. The kernel uses the drivers to talk to the hardware and do rest of the things required for the boot process to continue. 4 . Windows NT OS Kernel: This is the last stage which picks up the Registry settings, additional drivers, etc. Once that has been read, the control is taken by the system manager process. It loads up the UI, the rest of the hardware and software. That’s when you finally get to see your Windows 10 Login screen.",

Reply fahhhh fahhhh 5 months ago An on-site IT technician is attempting to resolve an issue with application performance on a customer laptop. The technician backs up the customer data and then replaces the memory in the laptop with known good memory. It does not resolve the performance issue. What are the next two actions the technician should take? (Choose two.) Escalate the issue to the next level support technician. Document that the possible solution did not work. (Correct Answer) Continue to test the next likely probable cause. Call the laptop manufacturer technical support line. Reinstall the original memory sticks. (Correct Answer) Knowing what to do when a possible solution does not resolve the problem is part of a good troubleshooting strategy. If you implement a possible solution and it does not correct the problem, you should reverse the action that you just took and document that the possible solution did not solve the issue. Once that is complete, move on to test another potential solution or escalate the issue to the next level.
