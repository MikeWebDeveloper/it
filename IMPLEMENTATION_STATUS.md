## üöÄ Strategic Recommendations & Next Steps

### PRIORITY 1: Testing & Quality Assurance (IMMEDIATE - 1-2 days)
**Status:** Critical Issue Detected  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Impact:** High

**Current Issue:** Router-related test failures in home page tests
- Fix Next.js router mocking in test environment
- Restore full test coverage (currently some tests failing)
- Add ExhibitDisplay component tests
- Validate exhibit loading across all 14 questions

**Action Items:**
1. Fix `/app/page.test.tsx` router mocking issues
2. Add comprehensive ExhibitDisplay test suite
3. Test exhibit functionality across all enhanced questions
4. Validate accessibility compliance of new features

### PRIORITY 2: Phase 2 - Accessibility Improvements (RECOMMENDED - 3-5 days)
**Status:** Ready to Begin  
**Effort:** Medium-High  
**Impact:** High

**Scope:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance upgrade
- Fix identified useAutoSave hook cleanup warning
- Implement semantic HTML landmarks
- Add ARIA live regions for quiz state changes
- Enhance keyboard navigation paths
- Validate color contrast ratios
- **Target:** Upgrade accessibility score from 6.5/10 to 9+/10

**Why Priority 2:** Accessibility is foundational and affects all users

### PRIORITY 3: Exhibit Content Enhancement (OPTIONAL - 2-3 days)
**Status:** Foundation Complete  
**Effort:** Low-Medium  
**Impact:** Medium

**Current State:** All 14 exhibits implemented with placeholder SVGs
**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Replace placeholder SVGs with detailed technical diagrams
- Add interactive annotations to complex exhibits
- Implement exhibit zoom presets for common viewing scenarios
- Add exhibit categories/tags for better organization

### PRIORITY 4: Performance Optimization (FUTURE - 4-6 days)
**Status:** Not Urgent  
**Effort:** High  
**Impact:** Medium

**Current Performance:** Excellent (234 kB first load, 1000ms build)
**Future Optimizations:**
- Split 271KB questions.json into topic-based chunks
- Implement advanced code splitting
- Enhanced service worker for offline exhibit caching
- Progressive loading for exhibit collections

### PRIORITY 5: Advanced Features (FUTURE - 5-8 days)
**Status:** Enhancement Phase  
**Effort:** High  
**Impact:** Medium-High

**Advanced Exhibit Features:**
- Multi-image exhibits with carousel navigation
- Interactive hotspot annotations on exhibits
- Exhibit-based mini-quizzes (identify components)
- AR/3D model integration for complex hardware

**Mobile UX Enhancement:**
- Gesture-based exhibit navigation
- Bottom sheet exhibit viewer
- Enhanced touch controls for zoom/pan

## ‚ö° Immediate Action Plan

### Week 1: Quality & Accessibility Foundation
1. **Day 1-2:** Fix test suite and validate exhibit implementation
2. **Day 3-5:** Complete Phase 2 accessibility improvements
